# Algorithm Lab: Algorithm Helper and Visualizer

**Algorithm Lab** is an interactive algorithm visualizer that demonstrates pathfinding techniques on a static grid using BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and A* algorithms — step by step and in real time.

## Features

- Supports **BFS**, **DFS**, **Dijkstra**, and **A\*** algorithms  
- Add/remove wall (obstacle) nodes  
- Adjustable animation speed: 1×, 2×, 3×  
- Modular file structure with a simple Node.js server
